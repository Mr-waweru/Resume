# George Gitau's Resume

This repository serves as a version-controlled system for my professional resume. By treating my resume as a project in Git, I am able to maintain a detailed history of changes, ensuring that the most up-to-date version is always available. Each time I make updates or revisions to my resume, I simply commit and push the changes to this repository. This approach enables a consistent and reliable method of managing and sharing my resume.

The resume is written in TeX, a powerful typesetting language well-suited for producing high-quality, structured documents. This allows me to fine-tune the layout and formatting while keeping the content clean, professional, and easily maintainable.

In addition, this repository will be connected to a GitHub Pages site (coming soon), which will host the latest version of my resume. This setup eliminates the need to manually upload or update documents across multiple platforms. Once live, any changes pushed to this repository will automatically update the hosted resume.

This workflow provides a seamless and automated way to manage, maintain, and share my resume with potential employers or peers.
